## !Important
If you get here you should move on to: https://github.com/christianalfoni/webpack-express-boilerplate. It is the boilerplate from this article: http://www.christianalfoni.com/articles/2015_04_19_The-ultimate-webpack-setup. It is just a better setup :-)

An example of webpack workflow, as presented in the following article [Creating a workflow with WebPack](http://christianalfoni.github.io/javascript/2014/12/13/did-you-know-webpack-and-react-is-awesome.html)

### How to use

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` - localhost:8080
- `npm run deploy` - deploy to dist folder

### Introducing the webpack cookbook
@bebraw and me have been working on a cookbook for React JS and Webpack practices. Check it out at [react-webpack-cookbook](http://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/) and build your custom config file with the best practices in the community.
